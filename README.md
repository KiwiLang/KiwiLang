Kiwi - data pack description language
=====================================

[Kiwi](https://buttersus.github.io/Kiwi/home) is a language for describing Minecraft datapack,
built with a focus on syntax, based on
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and some other languages.

## Quick syntax look

Hello_World.kiwi

```kiwi
fun main() <- load(always) {
    print("Hello, World!")  # outputs "Hello, World!" to the chat
}
```

Event_Kill.kiwi

```kiwi
fun killedEvent(player: selector) -> promise<selector> <- tick(1) {
    static kills: scoreboard(playerKillCount)
    if (kills[player] > 0) {
        kills[player] = 0
        return $promise(player)
    }
}

fun main(player: selector) <- killedEvent(@a) {
    when (player.name) {
        "ButterSus" -> print("You goddamn hacker!")
        else -> print("He sucks!")
    }
}
```
